## Tech stack
* Kotlin
* Jetpack Compose
* Clean Architecture
* MVVM
* Compose navigation
* Hilt
* Retrofit
* Room

<summary> <h2> Improvement options </h2> </summary>

* Use DataStore instead of Shares Preferences because there is integration with Coroutines and more flexibility, but Shared Pref was chosen to meet the requirement of the task for a minimum of third-party libraries.
* Use Shares Preferences instead of Room to store links to images by Downloaded and Favorite keys as "url1,url2,...", but this is not flexible and any addition will require a lot of changes and most likely a complete rewrite of all logic. 
* Use Kotlin Result API instead of Custom Exceptions
* Use Snack bar instead of Toast
* Move some repeated compose code to shared composable functions, for example CircularProgressIndicator
